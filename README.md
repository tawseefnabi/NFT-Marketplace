# NFT-Marketplace
The project that we will be building will be Metaverse Marketplace - a digital marketplace.

The marketplace logic will consist of two smart contracts:

**NFT Contract** - This contract allows users to mint unique digital assets.

**Marketplace Contract** - This contract allows users to put their digital assets for sale on an open market.
